    <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
    <p>To start with I would like to begin with a little introduction about myself and by background.  I am currently 36 years old but only just looking to begin my career in the IT industry (better late than never!).  Although I have always enjoyed working and playing with computers (right from the first Atari games console I started playing to the ultra advanced systems like the PS4 of today) and tinkering with new technologies.  Other than using computers throughout my school and college years I didnâ€™t ever give the IT industry a second thought as firstly my academic studies at university were in business management and law, and secondly because I have always had a misconception that the IT industry is for uber intelligent computer geeks, which of course is not the case.  As with anything, a little hard work and determination and anything is possible. 
    <p>It was a little over a year ago when I was involved in a completely different type of work when a chance meeting with a gentleman who persuaded me to change the course of my life and career and look into getting myself into the IT industry.  Said gentleman was himself involved in the cyber security side of the industry and did initially gear me towards that side but also insisted that the IT industry is getting bigger and bigger with more demand for professionals, and in some areas this demand is not being filled quickly enough.  But regardless of what area of IT I was to get involved in I can look forward to a lifelong career with excellent job prospects and a very good income, and so how could I argue with that!  
    <br>On a personal level I have always enjoyed IT and new technologies and so this planned move was a no brainer for me.
    <br>Having spent a number of months researching just how I would implement this plan I came across Code Nation earlier this year and registered to enrol onto one of the very first Cyber Security bootcamps that were taught there.  This was a real eye opener for me; not just in terms of gaining a very good understanding of the cyber security field but also as it gave me great confidence in knowing that I had the relevant knowledge and a good understanding of the industry to work in IT and very importantly that I would also enjoy it.  
    <br>
    <p>I am glad to point out that I passed the Cyber Security bootcamp with excellent marks and since then I have been researching further into entering the IT field.  So when I got a call from Code Nation with the chance to enrol onto the coding bootcamp I took the chance without hesitation as the more experience and insight I have around this subject, the better my chances are of securing myself a position with an employer.
