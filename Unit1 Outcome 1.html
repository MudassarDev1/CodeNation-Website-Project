<h1>1.1 The Purpose of IT in Modern Business</h1>
    <p>    <br>
        Chris MacKechnie writes that “Information technology (IT) has become a vital and integral part of every business plan.  From multinational corporations who maintain mainframe systems and databases to small businesses that own a single computer, IT plays a role.  The reasons for the use of computer technology in business can best be determined by looking at how it is being used across the business world...” from communication between employers, suppliers and customers with the use of emails and online meeting tools to video conferencing systems to live chat systems to help communication between these parties.  With the rise of smartphones and social media many businesses out there have understood the power and reach of such media and have heavily concentrated their efforts to include this technology in their business.  
        <br>Modern businesses that have looked to streamline their business model to ensure they only hold as much stock as they physically or financially can have implemented technologies such as inventory management systems.  Such management system also allow for up to date information and stock levels to be determined, shared and recorded with live tracking of stock levels.  This is similar to the use of management information systems (MIS) which enable organisations to track sales data and also productivity levels.  
        <br>Many organisations also make use of data management systems which eradicate the need to store large amounts of physical data in storage (such as filing cabinets) and in turn also save them time and money.  An added bonus of the use of such technology is that data and information can be instantly posted and delivered to all areas of the organisation.</p>
        <p>When it comes to the customer journey many organisations use IT systems such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems to record every contact with their customers to improve and manage their customer relationships.  The use of such systems helps the organisations to provide a more focused customer experience whilst at the same time helps to improve productivity. 
        <br>An example of this could be when a customer calls into a call center with a query or issue.  The CRM could help the customer service advisor see all previous contact with the customer and what, if any, were any previous queries; whether they were dealt with and resolved or what stage the query is at that point of the customer journey.

        <p><h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2><p>
<br>
        In order to successfully complete any digital projects you would need the relevant skills and tools for that project and with this being a digital project the tools would primarily be in the form of the hardware and the software that would be needed.  Digital projects can be in the form of websites, mobile apps, games, e-commerce and social media platform to name a few.  In some instances it would be useful to collaborate with colleagues.  This would help with the creating and the planning of the project plan, scheduling, delegating and tracking the work that is being carried out and reviewing and measuring the work.  Some of the skills needed to complete digital projects include collaboration, strong communication skills, problem solving, organisational skills including the ability to multitask and prioritise and the ability to pay attention to detail.  Up to date software can also help with the budgeting of the project.  For a project to be successful every task must be assigned in order for it to be carried out, either by a certain deadline or within a certain budget.  For all this planning and its implementation there are many softwares available on the market and we will discuss which software we are to use a little later.</p> <p> 
        Relevant experience in completing digital projects can vary from project to project as sometimes specific experience with certain tools is what's needed but for sure knowledge of up to date technology is a requirement.  Many of the skills that are needed, such as time management, planning and delegating could have been acquired from previous work experience however skills such as collaboration, strong communication skills, problem solving skills, attention to detail, etc are essential for this task.  <br>
        I have found that very commonly projects will be carried out using either waterfall or agile methodologies.  With the waterfall methodology being the more traditional approach and agile being a more favourable approach as it involves flexibility and collaboration.
        </p>
<br><p><h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website.</h2></p>
<p>
        My approach is to initially visualise how the website will look by drafting a rough copy of how I want my website to look on paper.  I will then use Trello boards to determine all the individual tasks that are needed to create my website.  Using the broken down tasks on Trello I will then be able to work on the individual tasks and complete them one by one and work out what I need to do and what’s left to complete.
        </p>

<p><h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects
to fail? Why?</h2></p>
<p>Some of the risks that might impact digital projects could include poor planning due to lack of experience and training.  This could result in poor use of formal methods and strategies when working out costs (exceeding budgets) and schedules (exceeding timescales) etc for example. 
<br>
Communication is key when working on such projects, especially where there are a number of people collaborating and working on one project but each doing an individual task.  Lack of experience in working with others can also lead to ineffective leadership styles which in turn could impact on productivity.  Additionally failure to track progress and performance can put a project at great risk of failing.
</p>
<p><h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems
and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2></p>
<p>
Selecting and using IT systems and software is a vital part of the project but never an easy task as there are so many competing products out there.  Although one method that can be used is looking at what you would like the software to do.  In this instance I am looking to create a website so some of the questions I will look to answer will include whether I will be using a local network, what data storage capacity is needed and whether any data will be stored locally on hardware or in the cloud. 
<br>
I have been tasked with using a Trello board primarily as it can be used as a time management tool.  Trello also allows me to label each part of the project that needs completing and also helps me to prioritise individual tasks according to the sequence or importance.  
I have been tasked with using VS (Visual Studios) as my text editor as I believe it supports a variety of languages from default including HTML, JavaScript and CSS; all that I will be using.<br> 
For this same reason I have been tasked with using GitHub to publish my webpages as it creates and stores a repository for my pages.
</p>
<p><h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control.</h2></p>

        <p>When analysing how my chosen technologies have helped me with this project I have found that setting out my project on a Trello board has helped me to visualise the tasks in hand into smaller more manageable tasks.  With Trello allowing me to separate the project into what is needed to be done, what I am doing (or working on) and what is still needed I can easily visualise the project in front of me.<br>
        I have found Visual Studio Code a very useful tool to use as it makes the coding of the project that little bit easier by colour coding the language on screen, which has helped me to understand whats being written on the page and allowed me to correct any incorrect coding on the spot.<br>
        Using GitHub was also a very helpful and useful tool as it allowed me to instantly view any changes I made to my coding.

<p><h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</p></h2>

        <p>GDPR is a data protection law that came into practice in may of 2018.  GDPR rules affect any company that collects or processes personal data of EU citizens.  Under the new rules, individuals have the right to be forgotten; meaning they will be able to request businesses delete their personal data, either because it’s no longer necessary or inaccurate.  GDPR will have an impact on all digital projects from Websites, Mobile apps, E-commerce and Social Media platforms etc.  If one has visited a website, it’s privacy policy should clearly inform it’s website visitors that their information is being collected and informs them of what type of data is being collected and how long they will store it for.  GDPR rules require sites to provide full disclosure of personal information.  To make my website GDPR compliant, the visitors needs to be able to change their mind and withdraw consent at any time.  The user needs to be able to have all his/her information properly deleted.  All given consent must be recorded as a document.</p>
