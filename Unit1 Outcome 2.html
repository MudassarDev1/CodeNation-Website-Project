<h1>Review</h1>
    <p> <h2> 2.1 / 2.2 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2> </p>
<p>            In making my own website the tools I used were Visual Studio Code as a text editor for HTMl and CSS, and Trello to help me manage my project and keep track of my work; what's needed and what has been done.  Using GitHub helped me instantly view any changes I made to my project. <br> I am very happy with the tools I used such as Visual Studio Code and Trello as they helped me to complete my project but also as I understood what they were used for. </p>
            
<p> <h2>           2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website?  </h2> </p>
            
<p>            I am happy with my website as it does what I intended it to do.  I have inserted a navigation tool bar at the top and bottom of each page for easy navigation around the site.  I have used different fonts and colours to identify different sections in pages and also have inserted some images to brighten the pages up.  
           <br> As this is the first website I have created I am happy with the overall look of the site although with further research into and knowledge of HTML and CSS I would try to make it a little bit more professional looking and easier on the eye. </p>
            
<p> <h2>           2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h2>  </p>
            
<p>            Having reviewed my project/website I feel I could change the background images on the pages as currently there seems to be too much going on in the background and in places it is a little difficult to read the written content.
           <br> I was also intending to insert a video somewhere on one of the pages as opposed to just images. 
           <br> Another further improvement I could make is to make the website accessible on mobile and tablet devices. 
           <br> I also think that I could have created a new email address to insert into the ‘contact us’ section of the website. 
        </p>          
<p> <h2>           2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h2>  </p>
            
<p>            Having looked at the final website I feel it looks like what I intended it to look like.  The navigation toolbars at the top and bottom of each page help users to navigate around the site easily.  It includes a section about me and breaks the different sections of the assignments into separate pages.  I feel the website is fit for purpose for what it was intended to do.
