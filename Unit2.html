<h2>Unit 2</h2>
<p><h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h2></p>  

    <p>         My final website will have a navigation bar at the top and the bottom of each page to help users navigate around the site.  The navigation bars will link to a few pages. On the homepage I will include a little about myself and my background and my aspirations for the future.  
                Next I will create a number of pages for Unit 1 (Outcome 1, Outcome 2 and a review of Unit 1).  Additionally I will include a page for Unit 2 and I am also looking into including a ‘Contact Us’ page just to gain further experience into creating websites and more practice and also incase I want to add my contact details at the end.  <br>
                Very importantly, a separate pages for where the CSS stylesheets are to be added will also be inserted and individually saved as a .CSS page. </p>            
            <p><h2>    1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2></p>
<p>                
                As websites are particularly open to abuse such as theft of content and images I am aware that the images can be accessed, downloaded and distributed (just as I have used images from the web).  If there was any content or images that were needed to be copyrighted I would have included a notice either visible on the site or as a comment within the CSS stylesheets.   One method of protecting images would be to by watermarking the images.  <br>
                As websites can easily be copied, one way of protecting the sites against copyright is to register the site (this can be done at https://secure.copyrightservice.co.uk/register/reg_online). <br>
                When dealing with infringements, in some countries such as the UK, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) has an obligation to uphold the law and so if found to infringe on any copyrighted material the ISP can remove the site. <br>
                There seems to be one exception to copyrighted material and that is the fair use of content and material from a website such as for the benefit of the public for research and information and the likes.  This exception allows for the limited and reasonable use of copyrighted material, as long as it does not interfere with the owners rights.    
        </p>             
            <p><h2>    1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them.
                </h2></p>        
        <p>        According to Sir Tim Bernars-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web <i>‘The power of the web is in its university.  Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.’</i>  Based on this ethos and when its implemented the internet is accessible to anyone regardless of their ability or disability.  But when its websites, applications, technologies or tools are not created based on this ethos then it can create barriers for some users.  It is essential for developers and organisations, when creating websites to create tools that allow access for all, to allow everyone to use their products and services. <br> 
                The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) was set up to ensure the web is fully accessible to all, enabling everyone, including people with disabilities to participate equally on the web. <br>
                The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognises the access to the web as a Basic Human Right. <br>  
                One of the ways I could have made my website accessible to users who are blind is to include equivalent alternative text (alt text) in the images markup/code.  This can help those who cannot see and so use a screen reader that reads out loud the information on a page.  <br>
                I could also have used a Keyboard Input in the instance where users cannot use a mouse eg older users or ones with limited fine motor control.  The use of a keyboard input in a website makes all functionality available from a keyboard rather than a mouse.  <br>
                If I was to include any audio in my website, another method to ensure it is accessible to the hard of hearing is to provide a text transcript which makes the information available in text form.  
        </p>        
                
                
            <p><h2>    1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2></p>
                
<p>                Although there are many filetypes for websites with many being very common, there are others that require specialist programs to open and use.  Some of the different appropriate filetypes for websites are -</p>
                
             <p>   .CSS - Cascading StyleSheet<br><br>
               CSS files are a tool that web developers use that help them change how their websites look.  CSS is a very appropriate tool as it allows a relatively boring and basic looking website to come to life. </p>

    <p>            .HTML - Hyper text Markup Language<br><br>
                
                HTML is a computer language which was created to allow websites to be created which can then be viewed by anyone via the internet.   Just like I have found HTML is a relatively easy language to learn and use.  </p>
                
 <p>               .JPG/.JPEG - Joint Photographic Expert Group file<br><br>
                
                Mainly used for photos, JPEG is a very common image file format.  Alongside JPEG there are a couple of other image formats that are regularly used in websites, GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) and PNG (Portable Network Graphics) with each suited for a specific type of image.
