<h1>Unit 1 Review</h1>
    <p> <h2> 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h2> </p>

<p>            One of the tools I used was VS Code, and I feel that it was very helpful for me, especially as a beginner, as VSC highlights the syntax as it's being written and not only does it auto complete the end of the tag name for you but it also colour codes the syntax to highlight the code to show you where you have gone wrong.  
 <br>           I have found that when writing code it also gives you a drop down box with different options that you can choose, this makes it easier to find the correct code that you are looking for.  
 <br>           I feel that another benefit of VS Code is that it allows you to use both HTML and CSS in it.  
 <br>           I feel that VS Code helped me be more productive and efficient as it allowed me to code everything in one place, at the same time it helped me with the code if I made any mistakes they were highlighted.  
     <br>       The only thing I feel could have helped me be more efficient in this instance would be to have more knowledge of VC Code.  This extra knowledge would help reduce the amount of further research I had to carry out on the internet to learn about VS Code and how to write code within it. 
  <br>
  <br>          
            I also used Trello to plan out my project and break down all the tasks that were needed so they could be completed in turn.  As this is the first time I have used Trello myself I don’t think I used all its features and to its full purpose but it still helped me understand the tasks in hand.  I feel that if this project was to work in teams, maybe we would have utilised Trello and its features more than I did on my own.  </p>
            
 <p>  <h2>          3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h2> </p>
            
<p>            I think maybe if this project had been completed in teams this could have helped improve productivity and efficiency as each individual team member could have completed certain parts of the project and brought them all together at the end.  Working in teams we could have shared knowledge and best practices and maybe not have had to spend valuable time researching how to do something.  <br>
            In the same way I feel that if I personally had more knowledge about coding and the tools we had used it would have helped me improve my productivity and efficiency.  </p>
            
<p> <h2>           3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h2> </p>
            
<p>            In order to improve my own productivity next time, I would increase my knowledge and understanding of HTML, CSS and VS Code alongside the other tools I have used this time around.  I think having more in depth knowledge of these tools will help me be more productive as I could spend less time researching how to do something and more time actually doing it.  <br>
            Other than gaining more knowledge myself to improve my productivity, given another task I think working in teams would help the project be more efficient as separate tasks could be allocated to individuals in the teams and they could all be brought together to make one whole project.  If such a project was to be completed in teams I think better use of Trello and Slack to help communication would also help productivity and efficiency.  </p>
            
<p> <h2>           3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h2> </p>
            
<p>            To test digital solutions I will look to load the website onto different browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.  
            Although I have not created my website to work with mobile or tablet devices, were I to include this in the code I could have tested the website on these devices.
